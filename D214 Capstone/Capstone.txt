The goal of this analysis is to answer the question: Can a random forest regression (RFR)
model predict the difference between a pulse oximeter (SpO2) and arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) reading using the given data set?

The context of this analysis is the common usage of SpO2 in hospitals and clinics. SpO2
is a convenient, non-invasive measurement of the blood's oxygen levels. A major benefit
of SpO2 reading is that it can be done continuously at a low cost. This stands in contrast
to the gold standard for blood oxygen saturation measurement, SaO2, which is collected
via arterial blood gas (ABG). This is an invasive procedure where blood is drawn from an
artery with inherent risks, such as bleeding, infection, and blood clots. Since it is not a
continuous measurement, multiple draws are often required.

Research has demonstrated that SpO2 does not always correlate accurately with SaO2,
especially at lower levels (Sjoding et al., 2023). Hidden hypoxemia, which is when SpO2
is > 88% yet the SaO2 is < 88%, may be present and remain undetected if solely relying
on SpO2 readings, leading to inaccurate diagnosis and delayed treatment of hypoxemia.
This, in turn, can lead to extended hospitalizations and poor patient outcomes.
Building a statistical model to predict the SaO2 value that uses only non-invasive
measurement could lead to improved hypoxemia diagnosis while reducing the risks
associated with arterial access. Venous blood draws are a common method used to
obtain lab measurements and are frequently done in conjunction when starting
intravenous (IV) treatments. The skills and risks associated with venous access are
significantly lower than arterial draws and measurements, allowing smaller hospitals and
clinics the ability to use these methods easily.
